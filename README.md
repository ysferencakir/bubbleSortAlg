🧮 Stack-based Number Sorting (C)
This C program uses a stack data structure to input, display, and verify the sorting of numbers.
It integrates Bubble Sort to arrange numbers in ascending order and checks the stack against the sorted list.

📋 How it Works:
Users enter 10 numbers, which are pushed onto the stack.
The program sorts the numbers and compares them with the stack order.
Feedback is provided if the stack's order matches the sorted list.
🚀 Features:
Stack implementation (LIFO structure)
Bubble Sort for sorting numbers
Interactive menu for user input
Validation of user sorting
⚙️ Key Functions:
initialize() – Initializes the stack
push() – Pushes a value onto the stack
pop() – Pops the top value from the stack
bubbleSort() – Sorts an array using Bubble Sort
Goster() – Displays the stack contents
